# MapLayer

The objective of this project is to learn the basic concept and features of the OpenLayer a JavaScript library to interact with the Map.

In this project, we have learned how can a user create a point, and draw a line and polygon on the map. 


## Working Functionality 
In this web app, a user performs below Operations:
     
     -> User can draw a point on any location.
     -> The user can draw a line between multiple points and can also  get the total distance of the line.
     -> User can draw a polygon and it will be filled with color and can also get the area covered by polygon. 
     -> The user can also clear all the drawings from the map using a clear button provided in the top left corner.



## How To Use 

When the application loads on the top left corner there are two options first is a selector in which the user will get 4 option 
like:
      
     + None
     + Point
     + Line
     + Polygon

Here by default, the selector is set to None meaning we will not do anything, draw a point we need to select a point and so on. 

The second option is a clear button to clear all the drawings present on the map.
